# 🗼 The Lookout Config

This is my personal config repo for my own home server lab.

This includes stuff like:

* Wireguard for VPN access
* Jellyfin and the *arr suite for media
* Transmission for torrent downloads
* all based on the linuxserver.io setup mainly.

Check it out and feel free to fork it if you find it useful!
